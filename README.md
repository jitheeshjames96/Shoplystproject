🚀 Shopalyst WebApp Infrastructure (AWS CloudFormation)

This project automates the deployment of a scalable, secure web application infrastructure on AWS using CloudFormation (IaC). It includes:

VPC with public/private subnets across two AZs

Auto Scaling EC2 web servers (private)

Internet-facing ALB (public)

Secure Multi-AZ RDS (MySQL)

Secrets Manager for DB credentials

CloudWatch alarms and notifications

GitHub-triggered CI/CD using CodePipeline (optional)

🧱 Architecture Overview

 <!-- optional -->

🔹 Key Components:

Stack	Description

VPC	Custom VPC, 2 AZs, NAT Gateways, IGW
Compute	EC2 in ASG (Nginx), ALB with health checks
Database	RDS MySQL (multi-AZ, private, SecretsManager)
Bootstrap	One-time EC2 to initialize schema/data
IAM	Roles for EC2 with minimal privileges
CI/CD	GitHub → CodePipeline → CloudFormation

🧑‍💻 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repo

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shopalyst-infra.git
cd shopalyst-infra

2. Prepare Secrets

Create DB credentials in AWS Secrets Manager with keys: username, password


3. Deploy via CloudFormation (Optional CLI)

aws cloudformation deploy \
  --stack-name shopalyst-master-stack \
  --template-file master.yaml \
  --parameter-overrides file://env.json \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM

4. CI/CD (Auto Deployment)

Commits to GitHub trigger CodePipeline → CloudFormation

buildspec.yml handles the deploy



---

🌐 Web Application

Static webpage served on EC2 (via Nginx)

Connected to RDS to show product data

index.html enhanced to include GitHub project link



---

🛠️ Bootstrapping Schema & Data

A dedicated template (bootstrap-db.yaml) launches an EC2 instance to:

Fetch DB creds from Secrets Manager

Connect to RDS

Create DB, table, and insert sample data


The instance is intended to be terminated after execution to avoid cost.


---

📬 Notifications

Email alerts configured via SNS for ASG instance launch/termination

CloudWatch used for CPU-based scaling policy



---

📈 Monitoring & Scaling

Target group health check + ALB

ASG with CPU-based scaling:

Scale out > 70%

Scale in < 30%




---

📎 Notes

RDS and EC2 are in private subnets

All credentials are securely handled via Secrets Manager

IAM follows least privilege principles
